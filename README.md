# Global Pollution Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

## Overview
This project analyzes global pollution data to find associations between pollution levels (air, water, soil) and energy recovery using the Apriori algorithm.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, mlxtend

Install requirements:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend
```

## How to Run
1. Place `Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv` in the same directory
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and categorization
- Association rule mining with Apriori
- Visualization of pollution-energy relationships
- Actionable insights generation

## Output
- Frequent itemsets and association rules
- Support/confidence/lift metrics
- Visualizations of key patterns
- Policy recommendations

## Files
- `Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv`: Input dataset
- `Pollution_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with analysis code

## Insights Example
"Countries with high air pollution often have medium energy recovery (confidence: 0.85)"
